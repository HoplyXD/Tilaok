# Tilaok!

> A Filipino party platformer where chickens build the level, then try to survive it.

**Tilaok!** (the rooster's crow) is our entry for the **DOST Level Up 3.0 Esports Game Dev Challenge** (finals 26–27 November 2026, GMall of GenSan, General Santos City).

Inspired by the build-then-run loop of party platformers, Tilaok! reimagines *sabong*: instead of chickens fighting, chickens compete in a trap-filled obstacle course, and every few rounds a **laro ng lahi** (traditional Filipino game) takes over the stage.

## Theme
**Philippine Games and Sports.** Traditional Filipino games are the core of the gameplay, not just the art.

## Tech
- **Engine:** Godot 4.7
- **Platform:** PC, local multiplayer (2–4 players)

## Status
P01 establishes a runnable foundation diagnostic harness, typed provisional configuration, content validation, and clearly labeled placeholder rooms. No movement, item, scoring, round, or event mechanics are implemented. See the [responsibility map and run instructions](docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md). Foundation checks run with the explicit Godot 4.7.2 executable; export evidence and team review status are recorded in [PLAYTEST](docs/PLAYTEST.md) and [PRODUCTION](docs/PRODUCTION.md). The PATH wrapper still launches 4.6.3.
