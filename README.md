# Tilaok!

> A Filipino party platformer where chickens build the level, then try to survive it.

**Tilaok!** (the rooster's crow) is our entry for the **DOST Level Up 3.0 Esports Game Dev Challenge** (finals 26–27 November 2026, GMall of GenSan, General Santos City).

Inspired by the build-then-run loop of party platformers, Tilaok! reimagines *sabong*: instead of chickens fighting, chickens compete in a trap-filled obstacle course, and every few rounds a **laro ng lahi** (traditional Filipino game) takes over the stage.

## Theme
**Philippine Games and Sports.** Traditional Filipino games are the core of the gameplay, not just the art.

## Tech
- **Engine:** Godot 4.7
- **Platform:** PC, local multiplayer (2–4 players)

## Status
P01 provides the foundation harness and typed provisional configuration. P02 adds a playable diagnostic movement/input room with numbered and shape-marked chickens, run/jump, collision/contact, pause/reclaim contracts and containment probes. It is not a full lobby-to-match game; physical controller, keyboard rollover, reconnect, human review and competition-submission interpretation checks remain open. Eight of 14 P02 tasks are verified. AI-assisted programming is the standing development workflow; Francis and Carlos are the development leads. See [run instructions and responsibilities](docs/PROJECT_STRUCTURE.md), the [tracker](docs/PHASETASK.md#p02--inputs-and-controller), [playtest evidence](docs/PLAYTEST.md), and [AI assistance disclosure](docs/AI_USAGE.md). Use the explicit Godot 4.7.2 executable; the PATH wrapper still launches 4.6.3.
