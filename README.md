# Tilaok!

> A Filipino party platformer where chickens build the level, then try to survive it.

**Tilaok!** (the rooster's crow) is our entry for the **DOST Level Up 3.0 Esports Game Dev Challenge** (finals 26–27 November 2026, GMall of GenSan, General Santos City).

Inspired by the build-then-run loop of party platformers, Tilaok! reimagines *sabong*: instead of chickens fighting, chickens compete in a trap-filled obstacle course, and every few rounds a **laro ng lahi** (traditional Filipino game) takes over the stage.

## Theme
**Philippine Games and Sports.** Traditional Filipino games are the core of the gameplay, not just the art.

## Tech
- **Engine:** Godot 4.7
- **Platform:** PC, local multiplayer (2–4 players)

## Status
Pre-production: reconciled specifications, PRD and phased tracker are available. The Godot project remains a skeleton with no gameplay scenes/scripts. Documentation completion is not a playable or tested game. The intended Godot 4.7.2 executable completed a clean headless import of an isolated project copy; the PATH wrapper still launches 4.6.3. Export verification remains pending because no export preset/entry scene exists and the installed `4.7.stable` templates do not match the editor's `4.7.2.stable` version. See [P00 evidence](docs/PRODUCTION.md#p00-baseline-record) and [verification status](docs/PLAYTEST.md#current-verification-status).
